<img src="./appendix/certificate.png" alt="certificate" width="1000" height="615"/>
This repository contains the code for the 7th place solution (Ryota Part) in the LEAP - Atmospheric Physics using AI (ClimSim) competition hosted on Kaggle. In this competition, participants were tasked with developing machine learning models that accurately emulate subgrid-scale atmospheric physics in an operational climate model, an important step in improving climate projections and reducing uncertainty surrounding future climate trends.
